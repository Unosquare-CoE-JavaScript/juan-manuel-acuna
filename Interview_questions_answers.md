####Tell me about yourself and your career as a developer.

- Ok, i've been developing software in professional way for the last 15 years, with a lot of technologies. I've had the luck of work on different positions, from lone developer, team member, team lead, and it manager. I've worked with different technologies as PHP, CSS, HTML, BASH, MYSQL, POSTGRES, FIREBASE, MONGO, JS, and, of course, React. I've had projects related with human care, education, finantial, process control, etc.

- About the human care, i've had develop a software for the administration of a retirement house, and this software can control all the file for every guest, as, photos, medical records, nutritional results, medicines, visits, and so.

- About the educational project, i've developed a software for the control of all the process in a private school. The software was made to control all the steps, from the auto check in of the kids, going trough the classes records, the test, notes for the teachers and parents, and the generation of a final file for the education autorities. It was an very interesting project. This project was made with php (laravel) and react in the front.

- About financial projects, I have had several projects. One of the most notable is software for granting credits to government employees. The software received all the data from the forms, processed them, analyzed them and, if everything was fine, generated the documents for the employee to sign. Once signed, the documents were scanned and uploaded to the software to be authorized by someone else, and the software began the administration of the loan. This software processed thousand of credits.

- Another interesting project was for the goverment of Jalisco, MÃ©xico. The software taked all the payroll of the goverment workers, and process it twice a month. The interesting part on this project, to me, was this: each worker can have up to 50 paychecks, and each paycheck can have up to a hundred different payment concepts. The most complicated thing was to identify and group these concepts, and then do the debt analysis for each worker. The goal of this project was control the debt level of each worker, to avoid the over-debt.

####have you started a project from the beginning.

- Yes, i've had the luck of work all the way with in several projects, since the requirement gathering with the product owner, the design, planning, develping, testing, the backlogs, the review with the team, to the deployment. My most recent experiencie was a software to a group of drugstores, from the reception of the drugs, the inventories, the sales, devolutions and reports. I was risponsable for the front end and i do it all in react. It was a very nice experiencie. I was leading a small group of developers, but i was also developing the project.

####What libraries have you used with react.

- Webpack, for boilerplate and packing
- ESLint for code quality
- Docker, for deployment
- Axios, for the queries
- Redux, for the state management
- Tailwind, material design for design
- Formik, for forms creation

####What motivates you in software development.

- Ok, thats a very good question. I love developing software, i really enjoy it. But i'm also very professional, and if i commit myself, i take it to the end. It will sounds very old style, i know, but it's my word, you know? My reputation is very valuable to me.
- In another hand, also i have to say, i have been very blessed, i'm healthy, i have a very nice home and a wonderful family, and i want to give back something, i want to make a better world, and i think the best way i can do that is doing very well what i'm doing. I'ts like a win-win agreement with the live. I think everyone needs to do their part to make this world better, and i'm doing mine.

####From your previous experience.

- Well, as i said, i've worked with several kind of projects, from human care, education, financtial, points of sale, etcetera.

####A challenge that you have had in your previous experience.

- Ok, the most remarkable i can think right now is a project with the goverment of Jalisco. Let me put you in context: the state goverments can make agreements with loan companies to give loans to their workers with direct payroll discount. Thats good, until the loan companies begin to over-debt the workers, and at the end, the worker get a paycheck almost in zero, and that's terrible, and illegal. The project we did was intended to know the debt level of each worker (about half million) and stop loan companies to give new loans to over-debt workers. That was the original agreement with the loan companies, and it also was in the state law. We need to process up to 10 millions records twice a month. Why 10 millions? Because there are workers than only have one paycheck and another workers get up to 50 small paychecks and every paycheck can have up to one hundred concepts.

####You prefer backend or fronted.

- Thats a hard question. I've worked in both sides, and i like very much both of them. I think backend is very powerfull, and can be massive, as i told you about the project with the goverment of Jalisco. The biggest challenge with in this project was the backend, because it can drive us to our goal, to reach better life quality for the workers. In another hand, i think front end can be very powerfull to, and efficient and easy to use frontend can improve the work time for many workers, as in the drugstore project. Before i did that project, the drugstores workers was using a very old and, i have to say, a really ugly system, and they hate it, and with the deployment of the new system, almost all the workers was very happy with the change.

####In the fronted you prefer to work on the design part or the code part.

- It depends on the project, there are some project where the product design with the product owner can be a really big challenge, but i also love to make code. In a prefect world, i think in a scenario where i'm envolved with the design, and also making code.
